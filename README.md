# 🚗 Driver State Detection System
**AI-based Driver Monitoring using YOLO & Streamlit**

## 📌 Overview
This project implements an intelligent **Driver State Detection System** using **Computer Vision and Deep Learning**.  
It detects unsafe driver behaviors such as:
- 😴 Drowsy / Sleeping  
- 📱 Using a mobile phone while driving  
- ✅ Normal driving state  

Users can upload **images or videos**, and the system performs **object detection** using a trained **YOLO** model.  
Results are displayed through an interactive **Streamlit** web interface.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Improve road safety using AI  
- Detect driver distraction and fatigue  
- Provide a simple and interactive testing interface  
- Apply object detection in a real-world scenario

## 🧠 Technologies & Tools
- Python  
- YOLO (Ultralytics)  
- Streamlit  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Pillow (PIL)
